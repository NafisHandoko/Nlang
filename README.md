# Nlang
Nlang (N Programming Language with Indonesian keyword) using Python 2.9

This is a programming language that I created myself using python in 2018 and I've been away from for a long time, but just put it on github recently. This programming language uses Bahasa Indonesia as its keyword, such as jika (if), selama (while), coba (try), kecuali (except) etc. To make this language I only rely on parsing strings. Sorry, there is no documentation yet and lack of code commenting
🙏🏼. Documentation will follow soon. Feel free to fork this repo if you want to contribute
